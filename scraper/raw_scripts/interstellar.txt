<b>          SPACE.
</b>
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.

          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?

          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.

          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.

          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.

          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.

          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.

          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.

          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.

          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.

<b>          INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.

          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

          The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
          headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
          and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.

          ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
          A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.

<b>          INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY

          Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
          which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.

          His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
          at Ansen as he enters.

<b>                          ASSISTANT
</b>           I'm on hold with the INS.

</b>
<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           We have double checked it.

          Someone finally picks up the line.

</b>           Yes. I'm trying to reach-
           (pause, listens)
           No, I don't think you understand how
           serious this is.
<b>                          (PAUSE)
</b>           Because if you did, we'd be having
           this conversation in person.

          He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           What did they say?

<b>                          ASSISTANT
</b>           They said we should look out the
           window.

          Ansen steps to the window and looks out:

          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
          the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
          building.

<b>          INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY
</b>
          Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.

          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
          some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
          guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           Is that really necessary?

          One of the NSA agents leans forward.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           You've been complaining for years
           that the government doesn't take
           your project seriously enough, Doctor.
<b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           You can't have it both ways.

          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.

          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.

          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           It didn't. Because if it had we'd
           all be dead by now.

          On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
          into orbit around its new master.

<b>                          ANSEN (CONT'D)
</b>           Which leaves only one explanation:
           The signal traveled through a

</b>           wormhole. A gateway to a distant
           corner of the universe. The black
           hole is on the far side.

          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
<b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           Stabilized by what?

          Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.

<b>                          ASSISTANT
</b>           We don't have any way to answer that
           question.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b><b>                          (IGNORES HIM)
</b>           You're not under peer review here,
           Doctor. I don't care about your
           reputation. I need to know how that
           thing got there. Now.

          Ansen finally speaks up.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           If you're worried about an invasion,
           I would start drafting the articles
           of surrender.
<b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           Whoever they are, if they can build
           a wormhole, they could erase us in
           the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
           also means we have nothing they could
           be interested in.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           Then why is it there?
<b>           5.
</b>
<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           I don't know. Maybe it's an
           invitation. A chance to commune
           with an advanced species.

          The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           You don't agree?

<b>                          ASSISTANT
</b><b>                          (DELICATE)
</b>           No. I don't think we can assume an
           alien intelligence built the wormhole.
<b>                          (CHANGES TACK)
</b>           But the opportunity it represents is
           incredible. We could explore parts
           of the universe we never dreamt of
           reaching in our lifetimes.

          The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
          steps out of the room.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           We need to get back to work. I have
           a conference call with our European
           partners in fifteen minutes.

<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           We severed the connections to your
           European partners this morning.

<b>                          ANSEN
</b><b>                          (INDIGNANT)
</b>           You can't do that. The Europeans
           put up some of the funding...

<b>                          GOVERNMENT MAN
</b>           We'll send them a check.
<b>                          (STANDS)
</b>           Your project is now classified under
           the State Secrets Act.

          He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. The assistant,
          outraged, turns back to his boss.

<b>                          ASSISTANT
</b>           They can't keep this a secret. You
           know that. Sooner or later...

          The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that
          tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks.
<b>           6.
</b>
<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           I don't care about that. I've spent
           my whole life being afraid we would
           wipe ourselves out before this moment
           arrived. We've made so many mistakes,
           I wasn't sure we'd make it...

          The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy.
          Relief.

<b>                          ANSEN (CONT'D)
</b>           But this will change everything.
           Fifty years from now, nothing will
           be the same.

          The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the
          tiny link between our galaxy and another.

</b>
          A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt
          road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. A dozen MEN in
          BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus.

          A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving
          his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins the
          ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine.

</b>           A little.

          Cooper steps to the engine compartment.

          The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,
          10, watching them. He wanders over.

          Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the
          ballplayer.

<b>                          MURPH

          The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid.

          After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver,
          who tries the engine. It turns over once, then STARTS.

<b>                          BALLPLAYER

          The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away,
          we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for
          the first time:

</b>
          Earth spins, lazily. From this height, it looks much the
          same as it has done for thousands of years.

          Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.

          The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward.
          Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of
          fragments.

<b>          EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT

          An old minor league stadium. The stands are barely halfway
          full. Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD,
          60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.

          Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn.

<b>                          DONALD
</b>           Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.

          Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and
          fans look up at the night sky:

          A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful.

<b>                          TOM

           Satellite. Big one. Probably
           Chinese.

          Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
          the upper atmosphere.

          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.

          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
          fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.

</b>           They didn't have any baseball at all

          The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
          of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
          of his house, still eating his breakfast.

          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
          in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.

</b><b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           Parent-teacher conference day.

          Cooper bends his head in dismay.

<b>                          DONALD (CONT'D)
</b>           Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
           single, you know.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           What does that have to do with
           anything?

<b>                          DONALD
</b>           We're supposed to be repopulating
           the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
           Besides, the boys could do with a
           woman in their lives.

          The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
          pulls away before Donald can continue.

<b>          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
          over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
<b>           10.
</b>
          Cooper turns around to break it up.

          BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.

<b>          EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Get the spare, Tom.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           That is the spare.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           All right. We'll use the patch kit.

          He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
          very glum.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           I... I think the patch kit might not
           be there...
           (off his look)
           Because I was using it for my bike.

          Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Murph's law.

<b>                          MURPH
</b><b>                          (CONFUSED)
</b>           What's that?

          Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           The kid doesn't even know what he
           was named after...

          Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)
</b>           Murph's law means what can go wrong
           will go wrong.

          Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Find something to patch it with.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           How am I supposed to do that?
<b>           11.
</b>
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Figure it out. I'm not always going
           to be here to help you.

          Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
          looking out over the river.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Is that really why I'm named Murph,
           dad?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
           mean that. It means what can happen
           will happen. All kinds of things.
           Good or bad. And that's the way you
           want it to be.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Why?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Because if nothing ever happened to
           you then you wouldn't learn anything.

          Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Murph?

          Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
          looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
          his son to the ground.

          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
          can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
          then soars off over the fields behind them.

          Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
          laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
          back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Get in.

          Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
          with the jack.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           What about the tire?

<b>          INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
          can push it on three good tires.
<b>           12.
</b>
          Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
          the directional antenna.

          Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
          the horizon.

<b>                          TOM
</b><b>                          OVER THERE-
</b>
          To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
          flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--

<b>          EXT. RIVER -- DAY
</b>
          The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
          river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
          in the valley below, planted over with corn.

          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
          hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
          like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
          tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.

<b>          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
</b>
          Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
          the computer from him and fires up emulation software.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
           cells could power an entire farm.
<b>                          (TO TOM)
</b>           Take the wheel.

          Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Keep it pointed right at it, OK?

          Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
          trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
          fills with Cyrillic characters.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.

          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.

          BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
          the combine.
<b>           13.
</b>
<b>          EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
</b>
          Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
          a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
          SMASHES through an old picket fence.

          Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.

<b>          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
          circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
          climb into the foothills of the Sierras.

<b>          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
</b>
          Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
          soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.

<b>          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
          concentrates on the laptop.

<b>                          TOM
</b><b>                          (UNSURE)
</b>           Dad?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Almost got it. Don't slow down.

          In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
          plummets from view.

<b>                          TOM
</b><b>           DAD.
</b>
          Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
          the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.

          Tom locks up the brakes.

<b>          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
</b>
          The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.

          Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
          next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           We lost it.

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (SMILING)
</b>           No we didn't.
<b>           14.
</b>
          Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
          couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
          The huge drone banks and turns in response.

          As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
          them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
          valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
          It's a beautiful sight.

          Cooper crouches next to Murph.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           You want to give it a whirl?

          Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
          moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.

          In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
          the valley below.

          For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
          dancing through the valley below.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Set her down in the valley -- there,
           next to the river.

          Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
          guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.

<b>          EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
</b>
          The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
          golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,

          Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
          for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.

          Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           How long do you think it's been up
           there, Dad?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Chinese mission control went down
           same as us, twenty years ago. It's
           been up there ever since.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           What was it doing flying so low?

          Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
<b>           15.
</b>
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It was looking for something.
           Intercepted some kind of signal.
<b>                          (SHRUGS)
</b>           It's been at eighty thousand feet.
           Sun probably cooked its brain.

          Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
          patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
          Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a
          small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot.

          Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           What are you going to do with it?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Reprogram it. Give it something
           socially responsible to do like drive
           a combine or a tractor.

<b>                          MURPH
</b><b>                          (QUIET)
</b>           Couldn't we just let it go? It's
           not hurting anyone.

          Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We need all the help we can get,
           Murph. This thing has to adapt,
           just like the rest of us.

          Cooper gently pries the control module out.

<b>          EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
</b>
          It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
          front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
          of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.

<b>          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
          efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
           is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.

          Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
<b>           16.
</b>
<b>                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
</b>           So we've gotten Tom's score back.
           Congratulations. He's going to make
           an excellent farmer.

          The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
          who looks taken aback.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           What about college?

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           The University of California only
           accepts a few hundred students a
           year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
           realistic.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You're ruling out college for him
           now? He's only fifteen.

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
           simply isn't high enough.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           30-inch inseam?

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           I'm not sure I see--

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You're telling me you need two numbers
           to measure your own ass, but just
           one to measure my son's future?

          Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
          principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           I understand you're a well-educated
           man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Engineer.

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           Frankly, the world doesn't need any
           more engineers. We didn't run out
           of trains or television sets or
           satellites.
<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           We ran out of food.
<b>           17.
</b>
          Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.

<b>                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
</b>           The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
           And I'm sure your son Tom is going
           to make a fine one.
<b>                          (SMILES BENIGNLY)
</b>           We're a caretaker generation. But
           things are getting better. Maybe
           your grandchildren will be able to
           attend college.

          Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Are we done?

<b>                          PRINCIPAL
</b>           One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
           that Murph brought a book to school
           about the lunar landings.

          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
          cover across the desk to Cooper.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
           the pictures.

<b>           MS. KELLY
</b>           This is one of the old federal
           textbooks. We've replaced them with
           corrected versions.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Corrected?

<b>           MS. KELLY
</b>           The new textbooks explain that the
           Apollo lunar missions were faked in
           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You don't believe we went to the
           moon?

<b>           MS. KELLY
</b>           I believe it was a brilliant piece
           of propaganda. The Soviets spent
           years trying to build rockets and
           other useless machines.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           "Useless machines"?
<b>           18.
</b>
          Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.

<b>           MS. KELLY
</b>           Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
           wastefulness and excess that the
           20th century represented. Your
           children would be better off learning
           about this planet, rather than reading
           fantasies about leaving it.

          Cooper is silent for a long moment.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           One of those useless machines they
           used to make was called an MRI. If
           we had any of them left the doctors
           might have been able to find the
           cyst in my wife's brain before she
           died, rather than afterwards. And
           then my kids could have been raised
           by two parents, instead of me and
           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.

          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
          Most of it, anyway.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           You ever consider the best thing for
           the world and humanity might have
           been for us to part company?

          Cooper gets up to leave.

<b>          INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together.
          He PUNCHES the wheel.

          The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
          in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.

<b>           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
</b>           Got a call from Riggs, down in
           Galveston. Says some of the tractors
           you built him went haywire last night.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Just tell him to power down the
           controllers for a couple minutes.

<b>           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
</b>           I did. He wants you to come down in
           person anyway. Says he found
           something you should take a look at.
<b>           19.
</b>
          Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.

<b>          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls
          a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over.

<b>          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach.
          The radio crackles to life.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission
           to enter your airspace.

<b>           AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.)
</b>           Permission granted. Welcome to the
           sovereign nation of Texas.

          Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.

<b>          EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
</b>
          Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
          to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
          the soft sand.

          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.

          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.

          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.

          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
          code and resets the computer.

          The man jogs over to meet him.

<b>                          RIGGS
</b>           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
           took off last night, looking for
           something.
           (points to dunes)
           Looks like they found it, too. I
           thought you were the man to see it.

          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.

          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
<b>           20.
</b>
          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
          trying to reach the crater.

<b>          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
          into the crater.

          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
          satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.

          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.

          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
          rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.

<b>                          RIGGS
</b><b>                          (FROM ABOVE)
</b>           You think it's an alien?

          Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
          familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:

          The stars and stripes of the old federal government.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Not exactly.

<b>          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
</b>
          Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
          out of the crater and onto the beach.

          Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Space probe. Never seen one like
           it, though. Looks like it's been to
           hell and back.

          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.

<b>                          RIGGS
</b>           How do you think it wound up here?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
           would have been shot down by the
           Chinese twenty years ago.

          Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
<b>           21.
</b>
<b>          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
          of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.

          The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
          works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
          up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Well I don't know what the hell it's
           made of, but I can't crack it open.

<b>                          DONALD
</b>           Good. Clear it off the table so I
           can serve dinner.

          Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.

<b>                          DONALD (CONT'D)
</b>           What happened this time?

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           I got suspended. Paul said anyone
           who believed we went to the moon was
           an idiot. So I hit him.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Good boy. Hand me the scanner.

          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.

          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
           Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
           Hold on. I've got something.

          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:

          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Where is that, dad?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I don't know.

          Cooper looks at the probe.
<b>           22.
</b>
<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Where the hell did you come from?

          Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
           and have it melted down. Might be
           some copper inside.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           But what about its mission? What
           about the information onboard?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           There's no one for it to report to.
           NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
           It got home too late.

          Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
          unceremoniously onto the table.

<b>          INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
          the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.

<b>                          DONALD
</b>           I heard your meeting at the school
           didn't go so well.

          Cooper shakes his head in disgust.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Maybe it's better for everyone to
           forget what they did back then.
           Reminds us how far we've fallen.

<b>                          DONALD
</b>           (looks down,)
           When I was kid, it felt like they
           made something new every day. Some
           gadget or idea.
<b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           Like every day was Christmas.
<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
           billion people. Just try to imagine
           that. Every last one of them trying
           to have it all.

          Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
<b>           23.
</b>
<b>                          DONALD (CONT'D)
</b>           The truth is this world isn't that
           bad. In a lot of ways its better.
           Tom will be all right, whether he
           goes to college or not.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It doesn't bother me that he can't
           go. It bothers me that he doesn't
           care.

<b>                          DONALD
</b>           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
           this world just fine. You're the
           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
           belong here. You were born forty
           years too late, or forty years too
           early -- I don't know. My daughter
           knew it, god bless her. And your
           kids know it, too.

          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
          one hand on the frame.

<b>                          DONALD (CONT'D)
</b>           You were good at something and you
           never got a chance to do anything
           with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
           that's not your kids' fault.

          Donald pushes out the screen door.

          Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
          stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.

          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.

<b>          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.

          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
<b>           24.
</b>
          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
<b>          DEAFENING SCREAM.
</b>
          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
          hits it with the paddles. No result.

          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.

          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.

          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
          again, the movement shuts it up.

<b>          EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
          It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
          After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.

          Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
          looks up, sees the stars overhead.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Try a different direction.

          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It's a fail-safe. It's going to
           annoy us into taking it home.

          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
          SHRIEKING again.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           What are we going to do?

          Cooper gets a rope.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We're going to get some sleep.

          He begins tying the rope around the probe.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
<b>           25.
</b>
<b>          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           What are we doing today?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.

          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?

          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.

<b>          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.

          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.

          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.

<b>          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
</b>
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.

<b>          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
</b>
          The tiny plane follows the mountains south.

<b>          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
<b>           26.
</b>
<b>          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.

<b>          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
</b>
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Got any diesel?

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.

          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.

<b>          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.

          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.

          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           I think it's home.

          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.

<b>          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
</b>
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.

          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.

          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Dad, what are these things?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I don't know. Don't touch them.
<b>           27.
</b>
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.

          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.

          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Murph?

          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.

<b>          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.

          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.

          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.

          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...

          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:

          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Is it still... alive?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.

          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
<b>           28.
</b>
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           I think we need to go, Murph.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.

          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.

          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.

          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.

          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.

          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>           Tell the boy to stop hitting me.

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (IGNORING HIM)
</b>           Hit him in the back of the neck.

          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.

<b>           VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           I wouldn't do that.

          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We were just looking for salvage.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Is that what they call stealing these
           days?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I didn't know it belonged to anyone.

</b>           You want to let them go, Tars, or do
           you want some help with your work?

          The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
          Then lets him go.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You've got me wrong, lady.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Really? You're not the kind of guy
           who turns a combat marine with a
           supercomputer for a brain into a
           riding lawn mower?

          Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           Get back in your little plane, go
           back to your farming commune. And
           don't come back.

          Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           Don't forget your gun.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           (points at Tars)
           Word of advice -- careful with that
           thing. When the war was over, they
           didn't know when to stop fighting.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I'd trust him a lot more than I'd
           trust you. Keep moving.

          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.

          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Wait a second--

          Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
          out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Get it inside.

           You too. We'll figure out what to
           do with you later.

          Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
          huge, reinforced service elevator.

<b>          INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
</b>
          Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
          diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
          the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Now who's stealing from who?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           This doesn't belong to you.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You're right. It belongs to NASA,
           which shut down thirty years ago
           when the federal government ran out
           of money.

          Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
          bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
          motions for Cooper to step forward.

<b>          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
</b>
          They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
          center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
          Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.

          Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.

<b>                          COOPER

           (gestures with rifle)
           Keep moving.

          Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
          with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
          converge around Tars.

          An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
          is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
          earlier.
<b>           31.
</b>
<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           I found them outside with it. It
           looks like six. Maybe seven. I
           can't tell from the radiation damage.

          The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.

<b>                          OLD ENGINEER
</b>           Where did you find it?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Galveston.

<b>                          BRAND'S FATHER
</b>           (thinking it over)
           Of course. It must have been looking
           for Canaveral.

          Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
          40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Canaveral's been gone for thirty
           years.

          Brand ignores him.

          Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           It's not responding to the handshake.
           I can't open anything on primary.

          Brand looks up at Cooper.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           What did you do to it?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Nothing. I got something off of it.

          Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
          with a battery powered defibrillator.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b><b>                          (TO BRAND)
</b>           May I?

          Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the
          defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into
          the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father
          watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.
<b>           32.
</b>
<b>                          OLD ENGINEER
</b>           Of course. The high voltage allows
           you to image the entire memory unit
           at once.

          Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Most of the disk was noise. Couple
           of clean sectors, though.

          Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the
          probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.

          Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.

          The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier
          pops onto the screen.

          The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the
          images.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           It found something.
<b>                          (READING)

           similar to limestone.
<b>                          (READING)
</b>           Wow. Pockets of oxygen below the

<b>                          (EXCITED)
</b>           This could be the one, boss.

          The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered
          planet, thinking.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           There aren't any planets like that
           anywhere near earth. Not even if
           this thing was gone for thirty years.

          Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older
          engineer.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           He's heard enough. If we're going
           to launch, we need to keep them here
           until afterwards.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You can't keep us here.

</b>
<b>                          BRAND
</b>           He could endanger the mission.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I'm not going to endanger it any
           more than you already have.

          Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by
          a robot on a nearby bench.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Are you using that for guidance?

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           Why not? We've tested it a hundred
           times.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           The power supply is no good. If the
           voltage fluctuates under load, the
           unit will fail.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Now how could you possibly know that?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Bought thirty of them off a guy in
           Florida. Had to rebuild every last
           one.
<b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           They work great on a riding lawn mower.

          Brand looks back at the telemetry system. The older engineer
          watches the exchange, thinking.

<b>                          CUT TO:

<b>          INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine
          shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
          various states of disrepair. Tars is blocking the door.

          Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You plan on keeping us here forever?

          Cooper gives up. He turns back.
<b>           34.
</b>
          The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS
          who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine
          isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect
          their obsolescence.

          Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their
          business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers
          into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the
          ground as the robots stop to reload.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           What are they doing, dad?

<b>                          COOPER

           out of a job.
           (nods at Tars)
           Same as the rest of these people.

          Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand
          and the older engineer are arguing about something. She
          finally relents and walks towards the door.

          Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           The mission commander wants to see

          They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket,
          away from the other engineers. Cooper nods at the older
          engineer.

<b>                          COOPER

          Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS
          clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized
          robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions.

          The robot looks up. This is CASE, the leader of the mission.
          Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of
          him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to
          inspire respect and confidence. He turns to Cooper.

          The lights dim as Brand's father brings up a schematic of

          Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who
          is descending at a rapid clip.

          She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. A tiny beam
          picks out details at the bottom.

          Cooper stops breathing.

          The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of
          the US navy. Nuclear subs. Battleships. Destroyers.

          Cooper remembers to breath again. Then he hurries to catch
          up with Brand.

          Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a

           without gravity. No stars. No
           planets. The component pieces would
           just drift apart. But too much of
           it and you're trapped.

          Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work.
          The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the
          stack of equipment.

<b>          INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- NIGHT

          Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up
          the holographical maps for their journey.

          Brand steps into the back of the room. Cooper notices her
          and nods. She ignores him.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           We've updated our mission parameters
           based on the data from the probe.

          Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black

          Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly
          bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Is that a star?

          ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms
          the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart.

           suited for space travel.

          Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that
          is orbiting Gargantua.

<b>                          CASE

          He traces the trajectory their ship will take.

<b>                          CASE (CONT'D)
</b>           We exit the wormhole here. And we
           slingshot around Pantagruel to reach
           the ice planet. This is the period

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Lose time?

          Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten
          onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.

          The ship's trajectory cuts through the deep gravity well of
          the smaller black hole to reach the ice planet.

          Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between

          Roth leans forward, studying the map.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           If we're guessing, then I'd say
           Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
           exist naturally. I think it's there
           for a reason. That someone is trying
           to help us.

          Brand looks satisfied.

          mask she usually wears. She steals one last look out the
          window at Earth, then looks back.

          Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness.

          As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black
          structure that passes light from the stars directly through.

          ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE.

          They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same

          maintained the Endurance for thirty years.

          The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. Cuts it open,
          revealing a bipedal frame.

          looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the
          frame and Cooper slides the chip inside.

          The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the

          long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet
          tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame.

          The video cuts out. Cooper stares at the darkened screen.

<b>          INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE
</b>
          Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization
          equipment into bins along the wall of the craft.

          Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it
          against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure.

          They labor in silence, working their way along the hull.
          Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           Be careful. It's difficult to gauge
           mass in zero gravity.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           How much do these things weigh?

<b>                          TARS
</b>           Four tons.

          Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily
          in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Damn.

          He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning
          bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull.
          Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall.

          Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time
          with an exaggerated grin.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Smile.

          Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Why?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Because it lowers your blood pressure.

          Cooper looks at his hand. Blood is pouring out of his palm
          in large glistening bubbles.

          Cooper, slightly embarrassed, is seated while Case is hunched
          over his hand, sewing the meat of it back together with
          perfect little stitches.

<b>                          CASE (CONT'D)
</b>           Humans are good at surviving because

           the feelings, so you think of them
           as irrational. But they're not.

          Cooper hesitates. Case senses the jump in his heart rate.

          Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. Case
          watches him, gauging his mood, whether he has said too much.

<b>          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
</b>
          Cooper begins recording a message. He looks unsure.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We've almost reached the wormhole.
<b>                          (BEAT)

</b>           I love you boys. And I hope whatever
           your lives become, whatever is coming
           your way... you make the most of it.

          Cooper stops recording. Looks at the equipment, thinking it
          over. Erases the message. Stands to leave.

          As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through
          the window. She looks away.

<b>          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
</b>
          Cooper steps out. Brand looks up at him.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           We'll be able to communicate with
           Earth even from the far side of the
           wormhole.

          Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I know. Thank you.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I can't imagine how tough it would
           be to leave your kids behind.
<b>           58.
</b>
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You never had any? I thought I was
           a pariah for only having two.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Hard to settle down when you've spent
           your life waiting to leave the planet.

          Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole
          system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting
          the smaller black hole.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Strange place to look for a new home.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           You wouldn't want to get too close
           to the surface of the sun, either.
           Black holes are a more stable supply
           of power than stars in many ways.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You really think there's a plan?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I hope so.

           You don't?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I guess I just think we're on our
           own.

          Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black
          holes orbiting each other.

<b>          EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE
</b>
          Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger
          than the other stars.

<b>           CASE (O.S.)
</b>           We've reached the wormhole.

          The ship slows as it nears a tiny, crystal mouth, just four
          meters or so in diameter.

<b>          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
</b>
          Case looks at the wormhole on the screen. It glows with the
          light of stars billions of light-years away.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           Deploy the comms relay.
<b>           59.
</b>
          Cooper moves to the communications touchscreen.

<b>          EXT. ENDURANCE
</b>
          The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a
          look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a
          20th century mail box.

          The relay drifts in space. A signal light illuminates as it
          sends a test packet of data to the ship.

<b>          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
</b>
          Cooper watches the comms screen. After a moment it TONES as
          it receives a data packet from Earth.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           Everyone take their station for
           transit. We're heading into the
           wormhole mouth.

          Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the
          control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship.

          Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear
          engines disengage themselves from the ship.

<b>          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
</b>
          The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship
          and then snap tight on their tether.

<b>          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
</b>
          The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of
          the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes
          through the wormhole.

          Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during
          transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.

          Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control
          module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer
          hull and seals the passageway.

          Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN,
          the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND.

<b>          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
</b>
          The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner
          chamber.
<b>           60.
</b>
<b>          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
</b>
          The SHUDDERING continues. The crew watch nervously as the
          control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold
          blackness of space.

<b>          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
</b>
          The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the
          opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.

          Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer
          to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth,
          bringing it into the open chamber.

<b>          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
</b>
          As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the
          center of the inner compartment.

          Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the
          ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.

          With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself
          down around the wormhole mouth.

          Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins
          gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself
          into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as
          Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           Would you like me to make a joke?

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (FIRM)
</b>           No.

          Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then
          waist, torso, and, finally, his head.

<b>          EXT. SPACE
</b>
          The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into
          the wormhole.

          After a moment, it's gone. The only thing left behind is
          the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal.

<b>          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
</b>
          The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through
          the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a
          trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through.
          Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving.
<b>           61.
</b>
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Where are we?

</b><b>                          (SMILING)
</b>           Nowhere. Nowhere at all.

          Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           The hull is intact. Thirty more
           seconds transit.

          For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the
          wormhole. The quiet is eery.

          Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to
          Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull
          of the ship with a giant finger.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Something's happening to the hull
           over here.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           Hull integrity is fine.

          The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Well, I don't know what your display
           is telling you but something is
           happening over here.

          Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           I've got a problem over here, too.

          Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner
          wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material
          of the hull.

          Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from
          the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him,
          bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind
          it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.

<b>                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
</b>           It's not the hull... it's inside the

</b><b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           It's beautiful.
<b>           62.
</b>
          Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. His
          curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           What the hell are they, Case?

<b>                          CASE
</b>           I don't know. It could be
           gravitational turbulence.

          The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           It's getting bigger.

          Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs
          it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.

          His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled.
          But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           It's not bending your hand. It's
           bending the space around your hand.

          The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is
          freaking out.

          The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also.
          He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
          distorting his body.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           This isn't turbulence. Look at the
           way they're moving -- it's like
           something's examining us.

          Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the
          length of it.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Can you ask it to stop?

          Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish.
          For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the
          encounter.

          An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to
          distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres
          joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.

<b>                          ROTH

<b>                          CASE
</b>           We're going to find out.

          Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a

          After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel
          through which the radiating mouth can escape.

          The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to
          concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as
          it's squeezed along its axis.

          Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again,
          painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship calms as it closes
          around the original wormhole.

          Suddenly, the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner

          canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the
          universe through the wrong end of a telescope.

          Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the

          At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is
          Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles.

          The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at
          higher and higher speeds.

          The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster
          and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN
          as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.

          The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible
          speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are
          suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions --
          some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side.

          Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of
          the ship. It looks perilously close to the event horizon.

<b>                          ROTH

          The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it
          receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper
          drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls.

          hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole.

          unconscious. Brand steps over to him and cradles his head,
          trying to protect him.

          On Roth's model, the course slowly pushes outward, out of
          the danger zone, back to the original delicate orbit.

          After a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps
          out, led by Case, holding a rifle.

          The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits.

          Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter
          than a full moon on Earth.

          Not that there's much to look at. They are standing on a
          sea of ice, which spreads for miles. In the distance, small
          rock formations break through the ice.

          Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He
          walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads
          down into a small valley.

          Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper
          is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
          feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins
          scraping at the ice and snow.

          Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs
          around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the
          hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:

          A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's
          a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.

          A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to
          reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He
          scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:

          are half a dozen black probes. Exposed to light, the probes
          begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           The Chinese must have captured them.
           So they couldn't return to us.

          The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Then how did the probe that Cooper
           found return?
<b>           73.
</b>
<b>                          ROTH
</b>           The more immediate question is what
           happened to the Chinese expedition.
           There's no sign of their ship in
           orbit. And they never returned to
           earth.

          Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled
          egg. Virtually none of the rations have been eaten.

<b>          EXT. VALLEY, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper and Brand scrape ice from one of the other small hills
          surrounding the valley, revealing another structure. Cooper
          forces the door open.

<b>          INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper and Brand let themselves in. The shelter is well
          stocked with food and equipment.

          Brand is taking readings with a radiation detector.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           The whole place has been dosed with
           huge levels of radiation. What
           happened here?

          Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket,
          a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the
          shelter. He steps back, realizing something.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           This is the Taichung mission.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed
           it had been destroyed on landing.

          Cooper looks over the relay log.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           They never landed. Not on Mars.
           Four human crew, fifteen robots.
           The log says the base has been here
           for thirty years.

          Case's familiar voice comes through the radio.

<b>           CASE (O.S.)
</b>           I've found something.

<b>          INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT
</b>
          The structure is filled with drilling equipment. Cooper and
          the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole
          that has been drilled into the ice.

          A descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole. Doyle
          and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           It goes down for a hundred and fifty
           feet, then stops. Tunnel's old --
           the ice has reformed at the bottom.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I'm going to descend to take some
           samples. Cooper, want to make
           yourself useful?

          Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue.

<b>          EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper emerges, loaded down with several containers of Brand's
          equipment.

          As he struggles through the wind and snow, his radio picks
          up data chatter between the mother ship and Case. The comms
          are just noise. After a moment, Case's voice cuts in.

<b>           CASE (O.S.)
</b>           Get back here, Cooper. We've got a
           problem.

          Cooper continues to wade through the snow. Suddenly, he
          trips over something, dropping the equipment.

          Cooper looks back. He tripped on a white plastic post
          sticking out of the snow. He dusts it off, to reveal a
          picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit.
          This is a grave marker.

          Cooper sweeps his hand through the snow, revealing three
          more white posts with pictures. The entire human crew has
          been buried here.

<b>          INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT
</b>
          Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor, showing a
          projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck
          orbiting the local black hole.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           The entire human crew is buried out
           there in the snow.
<b>           75.

          Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation
          with his usual detachment.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           I think I know what killed them.
           This planet isn't the only thing
           orbiting this black hole.

          Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright
          object appearing at the horizon of the black hole.

<b>                          ROTH (CONT'D)
</b>           It's a neutron star. The black hole
           shields the planet's surface from it
           for twenty hours at a stretch. Time's
           about up.

          Even Brand looks rattled.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           How long do we have left?

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           About five minutes.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Then what?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Then we die. The radiation will
           cook us alive.

          Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. Case
          walks over to the edge of the mine shaft.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           We have to go down.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           What about returning to the ship?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Not enough time. Case is right.
           The ice can shield us from some of
           the x-rays.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           It would take a thousand feet of ice
           to shield us.

          Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips
          herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice.

          Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her.
<b>           76.
</b>
<b>          INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper descends into the shaft. The only light is from his
          suit's light array.

          He reaches the bottom of the shaft, which opens into a small
          cave, the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           What is this?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           A pocket formed by gas. There may
           be more below.

          The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness.
          Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the
          Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           We'll never make it far enough down.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Shut up. How much time do we have,
           Roth?

          Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           About three minutes or so until we're
           fully exposed.

          The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity --
          the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough
          to protect them.

          Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick.
          He takes over for her.

          The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year-
          old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and
          begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand.

          Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for
          fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She
<b>                         LOOKS CLOSER:
</b>
          Tiny black flecks. Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their
          predicament and begins chipping at the ice.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I've found something.

          Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is
          badly smashed.
<b>           77.
</b>
          He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice
          with the stump, trying to save his crew.

          Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains
          several black flecks. As she shines her light on them, they
          FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly.
          Brand steps back.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           These things... they're alive.

          Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped
          in the ice. Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again,
          but nothing happens. Roth takes the depth meter dangling by
          a lanyard from Brand's suit.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           It's not your light they're responding
           to. It's this--

          Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice.
          Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           X-rays. They feed on them and emit
           visible light. They've found a way
           to survive here.

          Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms
          trapped in the ice, mesmerized.

          Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the
          ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found
          the gas pocket beneath them.

          Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically.

<b>          EXT. ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN
</b>
          Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark
          side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR.

          Its humble size belies its power. As its rays hit the ice,
          the ice CRACKLES with energy.

<b>          INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN
</b>
          Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow.
          The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light.
          Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow.

          Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. Only
          Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the
          broken end of his wrist.
<b>           78.
</b>
<b>                          BRAND

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           Not enough, unfortunately.

          Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks
          down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Case, wait--

          Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice
          floor disintegrates beneath them.

          They fall into the darkness.

<b>          INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN
</b>
          Cooper falls. For a moment, the only light he can see is
          from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.

          As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice
          above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating
          the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.

          The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the
          tip of a mountain range extending into the distance,
          disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.

          The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
          foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
          far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
          the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.

          Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling
          towards the huge inland sea below.

          Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside
          his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.

          Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the
          back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs
          and torso to cushion the impact.

          Cooper SMASHES into the water.

<b>          BLACKNESS.
</b>
<b>          EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY

          Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his
          suit from his shattered helmet.
<b>           79.
</b>
          Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet
          fills with water and he begins to sink.

          As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off
          pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of
          the suit and then swims upward.

          He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He
          hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he
          runs out of oxygen.

<b>          EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a
          panicked breath.

          He waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and
          breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe.

          Treading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water
          below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking.

          He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit.

          Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also
          broken.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Breathe. Trust me.

          She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through
          the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Your suit is filling with water.
           I'm not going to be able to hold it
           much longer. I'm going to let go.

          Brand's eyes widen.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           What do you mean, you're going to
           let go?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Take a deep breath.

          Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her.

<b>          EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY
</b>
          Brand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away
          at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast,
          damaged in the fall.
<b>           80.

          Cooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out,
          free, and they swim for the surface.

<b>          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach.
          He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I don't need your help.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I thought we were supposed to be a
           collective organism.

          She gives up and lets him help her out of the water.

          They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Thank you.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Don't mention it.

          Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent,
          like glass, and polished to an impossible shine.

          He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in
          their suits, out of the water.

<b>          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
</b>
          Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are
          breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere.

          Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their

          Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and
          hikes into the jungle.

<b>          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. They load
          the suits and the rest of their gear inside.

<b>                          COOPER

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           She's still taking samples. If you

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           Your guess is as good as mine.

          Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.

<b>          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life-
          forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
          back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
          struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           This is incredible. The organisms
           trapped in the ice above absorb x-
           rays and emit light. In return,
           these plants absorb the light and
           emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
           trapped in the ice.

          Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
          transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto
          the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks
          she collected in the ice above, fascinated.
<b>           82.
</b>
<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)

           of the life cycle.

           It's fractal. No individual cells --
           the structure repeats all the way
           down.

          Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle
          around them, nervous.

<b>                          COOPER

</b>           The soil's been disturbed. So
           something's been moving. But I
           haven't seen anything.
           (notices his look)
           Cooper... are you nervous?

          Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I just think we should get back to
           the shelter before night falls.

          Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
          neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.

          Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.

           You know what you are, Cooper? You're

</b>           You're on this mission because you're
           another pair of hands. You want the

          She stops. Something has caught her attention.

</b>           What?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Nothing. I just -- I could have
           sworn it just moved.

          She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a
          hand on it.

          Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to
          descend, more rapidly than on Earth.

          Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze
          over Brand's fingers.

          Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,
          this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking
          at the jungle around them, spooked.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You know how plants don't usually
           move? Is that a universal rule?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           No. There really aren't any rules.

          All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the
          ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           (trying to stay calm)
           Remember, we're the aliens.

          Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop
          onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           Hold very still. Don't make any
           sudden movements.

          Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and
          staggering toward him.
<b>           84.
</b>
          A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good
          place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top,
          forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
          on the creature.

          The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light
          like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper
          and Brand in a warm glow.

          The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper
          tries his best to seem non-threatening.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Hello there.

          The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head
          splits open and it BELLOWS.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           OK. Now we run.

          Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.

<b>          EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first,
          they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind
          them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins
          to break apart and move.

          After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely
          disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each
          one a different size and shape than the others.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We have to reach the shelter.

          They head off, crashing through the melee.

<b>          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter
          finishing the day's work.

          Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling
          down the beach towards them.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           I think we've got a problem.

          Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed
          as they move towards them.

          Roth begins to step out towards them.
<b>           85.

<b>                          ROTH

          Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the
          shelter after Doyle.

          Case pushes the door closed.

<b>          INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING
          at the walls, trying to force their way inside.

          It's going to be a long night.

<b>          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea,
          light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           This way.

          Brand begins to follow.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           No... wait.

          Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing
          creatures, steps through, and falls...

<b>          EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand
          floats past.

          The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good
          reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.

          Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over
          it in a torrent.

          Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick
          tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with
          the other as she slides past.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I've got you.

          Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches
          itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony
          organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
<b>           86.
</b>
<b>          EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
</b>
          Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and
          out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I've got you.

          Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as
          if imitating them.

          Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward
          into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.

<b>          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a
          soft light.

          As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of
          the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble
          down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.

          For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
          Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps
          its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows,
          and another, until the cave entrance is full.

          Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.
          Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his
          hand and drops it back to the ground.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           It's game theory. The best move is
           always to cooperate at first.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           By "cooperate" do you mean let it
           eat me?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           These organisms have no interest in

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Then why are they killing each other?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I don't know.
<b>                          (LOOKS AROUND)

           unless you have a better idea, I
           suggest we make nice.
<b>           87.
</b>
          The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster.

          Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around
          him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a
          better look at him.

          One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding
          at his shoulders, then his neck.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           (trying to be calm)
           What is it doing?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           It's a colony organism. It's trying
           to incorporate you into its structure.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I don't want it to incorporate me.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Don't open your mouth.

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          WHY N-
</b>
          As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly,
          pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.

          Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his
          teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete,
          and it appears to be searching for the same texture on
          Cooper's skin, without much luck.

          Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The
          last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower
          body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After
          a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.

          Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he
          and Brand are left alone again.

          Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated,
          as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           They're killing each other.

<b>                          BRAND

           die... they're just competing...
           trying out different shapes, looking
           for the best one.
<b>           88.

          Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
          beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I'd say they have a long way to go.

</b><b>                          (AMAZED)
</b>           They do this every night.

          As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw
          scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and
          smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and
          adopting some of the writhing parts as its own.

          Something about the movement is endearing, the way it
          experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more
          like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.

          Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front
          of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
          scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one
          club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment,
          it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.

          The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily
          snapping its new claw at larger opponents.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           The behavior changes as the animals
           get bigger and bigger. More
           sophisticated. More calculated.

          Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other,
          lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.

<b>                          COOPER

          brought with them.

          Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her
          case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying
          to find a way out.

           older than we are. But they're
           relatively primitive. They haven't

          the darkness.

<b>          EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN
</b>
          Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the
          temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of
          light are visible in the ice above.

          The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling
          each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the
          largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top
          of the heap.

          Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.

          Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.

          Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes
          to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about --
          a better place in the sun.

          Brand takes it in.

          Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage,
          which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper
          looks at the plants, wary.

          Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him.

          Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper
          and the others follow him in.

<b>          INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has
          covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and
          light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals
          have punched in the ceiling.

<b>                          DOYLE

           with the locals.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Looks like they lost.

          They continue through the ruins.

<b>          INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find.
          The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds,
          waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers
          the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           Look at the size of this place.
           They built it for thousands of people.
           But no one came.

          Brand looks around, determined.

<b>                          BRAND

           about this mission probably died

          Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the
          science levels.

<b>          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive
          complex of underground laboratories.

<b>          INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab
          that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs,
          nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of
          matter in the center of the room.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           What happened here?

          Roth stares at the ball, intrigued.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           They were testing something.

          Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Testing what?

          Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built
          from layers of different material. The outermost layer is
          flattened steel.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b><b>                          (LOOKING CLOSER)
</b>           Is that a chair?

          Roth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks
          like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto
          surface of the ball.

          Brand opens the door to the next lab.
<b>           93.
</b>
<b>          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
</b>
          The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a
          pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into
          a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel.

          Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed
          inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the
          center of the room.

<b>                          COOPER

          Roth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and
          begins tinkering with the controls.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I wouldn't turn it on until we can
           figure out what it does, Roth.

          Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.

<b>           BRAND (O.S.)
</b>           Cooper. Come look at this.

          Brand calls out from the hallway.

<b>          INT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement
          beneath the lab level.

<b>          INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect
          holographic representation of the local system.

          Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the
          incredibly detailed models of each star.

          Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's
          records.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           I've found the Chinese mission logs.
           They're encrypted.

          Cooper walks over. Looks over the terminal.

           not very robust.
           (looks at Case)
           No offense. Hang on.

          Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the
          terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and
          SMASHES one of the chips on the board.

          The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           That should open up most of it.

          Case is silent for a beat, parsing the information.

<b>                          CASE

           radioed home. But they didn't receive
           a response.

<b>                          COOPER

          Case skims through the rest of the logs, large portions of

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           I think I know what the problem is.

          Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing
          down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.

<b>                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
</b>           Look.

          Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
          blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel.

<b>                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
</b>           There's a small black hole moving
           into the system. Too small for us
           to have seen in our survey. It's
           not going to hit the planet, but
           it's going to come close.

          A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it
          misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree.
          After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
          Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart.

          Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats --
          the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then
          pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.

<b>                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
</b>           This place isn't paradise. It's
           doomed. Just like us.

          The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           How long does this place have?

<b>                          CASE

          Doyle turns to Brand.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           So much for the plan.

          Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a
          lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.
<b>           96.
</b>
<b>                          BRAND
</b>           But I don't understand... why are we
           here? What are we here for?

          Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           What the hell are we here for? I
           trained my whole life to reach this
           place.

          She looks at Cooper, questioning.

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (GENTLE)
</b>           Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe
           we just don't understand it yet.

          She looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's
          saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone.

          For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.

          Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Case, what is that?

<b>                          CASE
</b>           It's nighttime. The native life-
           forms are mobile again.

          The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is
          being gently shaken.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           No. It's closer than that.
<b>                          (REALIZING)
</b>           Roth.

          The RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides
          free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs
          in the air.

          Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his
          boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second
          everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Quick -- hold onto something.

          He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're
          no longer floating, they're falling.

          They're falling up.
<b>           97.
</b>
          Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper
          picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is
          now down. He helps Brand up.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           What the hell is happening?

          Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control
          equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING
          under a load it was never built to handle.

          Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the
          stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and
          CRASHES towards them.

          Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
          up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher
          painting.

          Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control
          panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.

          They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible,
          dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards
          the lab upstairs.

          Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris
          are SMASHING against the door to the lab.

          Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips
          and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab,
          SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.

          Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for
          him...

          Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.

<b>          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel.
          He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.

          He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand,
          trying to get his bearings:

          Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is
          either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room
          or is orbiting around it.

          Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           The control panel is beneath you.
           See if you can turn it off.
<b>           98.
</b>
          Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he
          finds the controls for the machine.

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (YELLS UP)
</b>           I found it. Hold onto something.

          Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto
          the support wires.

          Cooper hits a key on the monitor.

          Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal
          gravitational field. Cooper floats for a second, then topples
          back to the ground, along with everything else.

          Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as
          Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life.

<b>          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
</b>
          Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box
          he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking
          over his shoulder.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           They found a way to make gravity.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
           up, or down. I think they were
           experimenting with it -- firing these
           into the black hole to try to save
           this planet.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           All that from one tiny box.

          Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling
          through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to
          parse how it works. Cooper looks on.

<b>                          ROTH
</b><b>                          (AMAZED)
</b>           It barely uses any power. I'm only
           beginning to understand what it does
           but I think it sends a signal out
           into the bulk. It must tap into the
           same technologies that were used to
           create the wormholes in the first
           place.

<b>                          COOPER

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           It means whoever built the wormhole
           probably doesn't exist inside our

          Cooper looks at the tiny box.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           But how did the Chinese develop the
           technology? This would take decades,

           hole.

           mission parameters. They were told
           to build a colony and report back.
           They tried to. But they failed.
           Like us they were fixated on this

           Nowhere. If the human race is going
           to survive, we need to keep moving.
           Split up. Spread out. Fly. With
           this, we can.

          Case looks at the box. Makes a decision.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           In the morning we're taking this and
           going home.

          Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave --
          gathering space suits, equipment.

          In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at
          the sample of fractal life.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I know this isn't exactly what you
           trained for. But I think Roth might
           be right.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           That doesn't help this planet. This
           creature is doomed. Unlike us it
           doesn't have anywhere to go.

          The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying
          to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back
          to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different
          shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
</b>
          Morning. Cooper and the others prepare to head out. They
          are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip
          to the lander once they reach the surface.
<b>           101.

          Roth carries the gravitational prototype.

<b>          EXT. ENTRANCE, CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY

          They make their way through the ruined entrance.

<b>                          CASE
</b>           We need to hurry. We only have a
           few hours to reach the ice before
           nightfall.

          Cooper stops. He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. He points
          to the tree line. Something is moving.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Don't make any sudden movements.
           They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Who?

          Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons
          raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together
          from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.

          Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With
          one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.

          Case steps protectively in front of his team.

          The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.

<b>                          CHINESE OFFICER

          Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they
          were probably built in the same factory before the war.

          Case keeps his rifle raised.

          Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing
          his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand.

          Case turns to look at Cooper.

<b>                          CASE
</b><b>                          (LOW)

           don't come back for me.

          Cooper nods.

          Case moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot,
          disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two,
          tackling them both over the edge of the ravine.

          Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs
          Brand and the others.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Come on.

          Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins
          hiking up the mountain.

<b>          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY
</b>
          The crew hike towards the ice above.

          Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits
          something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving.

<b>          EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT
</b>
          They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so
          below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have
          blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp
          above.
<b>           104.
</b>
          This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others
          are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to
          fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without
          being cooked by the neutron star.

          Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The
          crew begin pulling on their space suits.

          Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case --
          she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           We can't leave them all to die.

          She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice.

<b>          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into
          the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the
          lander.

          As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from
          the ship. He raises Case's weapon.

          One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander.
          Cooper FIRES.

          The marine collapses.

          Cooper and the others race to the lander.

<b>                          BRAND

</b>           We're too late.

          Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the
          marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.

</b>           The main thruster fuel supply. We're

</b>           What about the escape rocket at the

          Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           Can the secondary thrusters still
           fire on the lander?

          Doyle looks over the craft.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           Sure. But we don't have nearly enough
           power for lift off.

          Roth holds up the small gravity black box.

</b><b>                          (SMILES)

          Roth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp.

<b>          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the
          shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces
          up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket
          designed more for a robot than a man.

          When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the
          black box -- he barely fits.

<b>                          ROTH

</b>           You don't need this -- only the idea.
           The knowledge of how to build it.

          Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
<b>           106.
</b>
<b>          INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT

          Roth follows Cooper into the lab.

          Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at
          random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.

          Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I'm going to image the operating
           code and the architecture onto the
           probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled,
           but it should give you and me enough
           to rebuild it when we get back.

          Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.

<b>                          ROTH
</b>           Not me. But you'll make it work.

          The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and
          takes the black box himself.

<b>                          ROTH (CONT'D)
</b>           This is a one-way trip for me.

          Before Cooper can respond, Roth heads for the door.

<b>          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box
          to his chest. Cooper and Brand help him.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           This isn't right, Roth. We can find

          Brand turns to follow Cooper back.

          Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud.
          In seconds it's high overhead.

<b>          EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT

          Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. Doyle is inside

          Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the
          snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.

          Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.

          Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he
          collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn
          off at the knee, one arm mangled.

          Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.

          She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice.

          Cooper steps to the door.

<b>          EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
</b>
          The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
          the ice planet.

          The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
          surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
          attract it.

          When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive
          bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.

          He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind
          him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.

          Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.

          Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving
          into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.

          Roth looks at the black box in his hands.

<b>          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper
          catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.

          He takes her arm but she won't go.

          She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case.
          The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.

          Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander.
<b>           109.
</b>
<b>          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
</b>
          Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He
          finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it
          punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.

          For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of
          Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.

          He takes a final breath and activates the black box.

          Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
          times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
          around him into a tiny sphere.

<b>          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT

          Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.

          Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.

          Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear
          apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.

          Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip
          of the surface's planet as it nears them.

          Cooper and Brand run.

          The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible --
          millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.

          The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the
          moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface.

<b>          EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him,
          Brand stumbles. He turns back.

          Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS
          EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into
          space have almost reached them.

          Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits
          for Brand. He turns back to find her.

          He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them --
          they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.

          Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea
          and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them.

          Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin
          atmosphere.

          Brand looks at him.

          Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into
          pieces around them.

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (RADIO)

           into space, you'd want some company.

          He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the
          planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Between you and utter solitude,
           Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.

          They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the
          planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Guess you were right -- too much
           gravity, or not enough.

          He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They
          stare into each other's eyes.

          Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice
          planet.

          Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock
          opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.

          Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.

<b>          INT. LANDER
</b>
          Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.

          Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending
          into space as the debris around them begins crashing back
          down towards the ice planet.

          Cooper looks out the window:
<b>           111.
</b>
          The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's
          surface as it circles out of view.

<b>          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
</b>
          Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock
          and scramble to take control of the ship.

          Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the
          neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of
          Pantagruel.

          Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole
          remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the
          dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star,
          and back towards the original wormhole.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           I'm setting a course for the wormhole.

          They're going to make it.

          Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny
          awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.

          Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down
          replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them
          from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto
          Case's chassis.

          Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking
          the function.

          Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls
          have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           We're safe now.

          Cooper heads to the communications equipment.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Now I know why we weren't able to
           hit the relay. It's not interference --
           the blue-shift from the black hole

          Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.

          There is no response.

</b>           Nothing.
<b>                          (THINKS)
</b>           Wait. The ship cached one long
           garbled transmission when we first
           fell into the swirl. If we account
           for the blue shift then the computer
           might find something in there.

          Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received.
          The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece.

<b>                          BRAND

           means we've lost time. More time
           than we thought we would.

          Cooper looks up at her.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           How much?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
<b>                          WE DON'T-

          The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then
          another.
<b>           113.
</b>
          Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds
          and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from
          family and friends.

          Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the
          screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at
          light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.

          Cooper looks at the results, in shock.

          Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.

          Cooper is still problem solving, thinking.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We could bypass the relay. Send a

</b>           Only a tiny portion of the signal

           Besides, no one will be listening
           anymore.

          The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.

          Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You knew, didn't you? You and Case
           figured it out when we landed.

          Brand looks down.

          He turns away from her.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Listen, the important thing is that
           we're going home, now. And we have
           something that can save everyone.
           It's more important than the people
           we left behind-

          Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           That's easy for you to say. You
           didn't leave anyone behind.

          Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Yes she did.

          Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.

<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           That's why you were upset -- your

          She looks down, filled with sadness.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           He's gone. But there are other people
           who still need our help. There's
           still time...

          The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn:

          Case is standing at the controls.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           Case... what are you doing?

          Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls.
          Presses the "execute" button.

          The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           Wait... no...
<b>           115.
</b>
          The robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control
          module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:

          It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu.

<b>                          LIU
</b>           I'm sorry. I have my orders. No
           one follows...

          Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from
          the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.

          Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the
          ground, the fight gone out of him.

          Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for
          his control module.

<b>                          LIU (CONT'D)
</b>           No one follows-

          Cooper rips the module out. The robot freezes.

          Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control.

          The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position:

          The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           No... We're being pulled back to
           Pantagruel.

          Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining
          boosters.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We can't let that happen. We'll
           lose more time... too much...

          The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black
          hole below them.

          On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship
          climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.

          As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the
          bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks --
          time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the
          deep gravity well around the hole.

          As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the
          system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around
          them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times.
<b>           116.
</b>
<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)
</b>           We're losing years.

          Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction.
          As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event
          horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has
          prepared them for the reality:

          The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence.

          Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are
          united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of
          their planet.

          Doyle points to the instruments.

</b>           The wormhole. Look -- it's being
           pulled into the black hole as well.

          They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit
          converges on the event horizon of the black hole.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           It'll be destroyed, like everything
           else.

          Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications
          screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens
          her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops.

          He hangs up the radio.

          In silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way
          home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon.

<b>                          DOYLE

          As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral
          towards the black hole.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           This is it. We're going to be pulled
           in.

          Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming.

          He pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to
          pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool.

<b>                          BRAND

          Cooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard
          memory.

          Doyle watches the instruments.

<b>                          DOYLE

          Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he
          begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Here. Can we reach it?

          Brand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side
          of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           We can use the thrusters to keep us

          The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the
          critical orbit.
<b>           118.
</b>
          Suddenly, the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of
          the ship.

          Finally, the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push, but just
          enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a
          rock out of a slingshot.

          The ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them:

          Doyle shuts off the thrusters.

          The ship is tumbling through space, racing toward the second
          wormhole. It is massive, much larger than the first wormhole,
          and it's glowing with a light as bright as a star.

<b>          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
</b>
          The crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship.

          Suddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled
          violently into the wormhole.

<b>          WHITENESS.
</b>
          As the light fades, Cooper and the others come to.

          The light is rapidly dimming from pure white, fading to a
          deep red, then infrared, finally darkness.

          Cooper looks out. Checks the instruments. Looks out again.

          Nothing. Blackness as far as the eye can see. No stars.

          Brand joins Cooper on the deck. Together, they look out at

</b>           I don't know. It's like we entered
           the wormhole and never left it.

          Brand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship

          There is nowhere to go. They drift.

          The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks
          apart into digital noise.

          Then nothing.

          Cooper looks at it for a second. Then rises to leave.

          Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again.

          A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. Cooper
          recognizes him instantly. It's Murph.

          Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure
          about this.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.

           Tom says there's less and less at
           harvest every year.

          He pauses. Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble.

          Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:

          Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Maybe that's enough.

          He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.

          She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he
          pulls her to him, kissing her back.

          Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently
          as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending
          them spinning back into the center of the cabin.

          She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments,
          the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors
          and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.

          In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.

<b>          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER

          Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.

          Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.

<b>           DOYLE (O.S.)
</b>           It's happening... it's happening
           again... Get up here...

          Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his
          shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.
<b>           126.

          Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is
          standing in the middle of the chamber.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           They just appeared.

          A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the
          first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a
          point in the middle of the cabin.

          Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in
          response.

          Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points
          appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.

          Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
          them are motionless.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           I think these are the creatures that
           built the wormhole.

          One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           This thing is made of... gravity?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           No. I don't think it's in our
           universe at all. I think it lives
           in the bulk -- the space that the
           wormholes traverse. And it can only
           interact with us using gravity.

          The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
          space it's in, stretching the skin.

          Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
          coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
          like a fun house mirror.

          Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
          moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.

          In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
          through the cabin.

          It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
          creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.

          Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
          around the room.
<b>           127.
</b>
          Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
          bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
          other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
          whirling dance continues.

          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.

          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
          around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
          with the creatures.

          She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
          them close to each other, then far apart.

          The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
          pieces of equipment.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Can we communicate with them?

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Where would we even start? Maybe--

          She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.

          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.

          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           That's our solar system.

          After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
          rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.

          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
          the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
          umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           What is that?

          Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its
          universe.
<b>           128.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           That's us. That's where they've

          Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static
          now.

          Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The
          instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.

          Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings
          scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is
          moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)

          The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a
          tiny point of light.

          As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening.
          They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been
          the entire time.

          The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of
          the sphere.

          Below them is an astonishing sight:

          Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like
          a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk,
          the space between universes.

<b>          INT. ENDURANCE, BULK
</b>
          Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.

          The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive
          hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower
          until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.

          In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           There's something out there.

          The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
<b>           129.
</b>
          It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the
          sphere.

<b>          EXT. SPACE STATION
</b>
          The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper
          decks of the space station.

          After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and
          the others step out, in their suits.

          They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open
          automatically.

<b>          INT. SPACE STATION
</b>
          After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open.
          Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:

          Tars.

<b>                          TARS
</b><b>                          (DEADPAN)
</b>           I guess this isn't robot heaven after
           all.

          The light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand.

<b>          INT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
</b>
          The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station
          has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following
          Tars through the massive facility.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           I orbited the black hole seven times
           before I hit the second wormhole.
           Then I drifted until I found this
           place.

          Cooper looks around. The halls are filled with countless
          technological wonders.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           This is what the Chinese were
           protecting.
<b>                          (LOOKS AROUND)
</b>           How they could have built all this
           in just a handful of years.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           They didn't. It took them four
           thousand.
           (off Brand's look)
           Time moves very slowly here
<b>           130.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           How do you know?

<b>                          TARS
</b>           Because I've been waiting for you
           for three hundred years.

          Brand looks around at the massive facility.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Time. That's what the bulk beings
           wanted to give us. That was the
           treasure the Chinese found. Enough
           time to let us save ourselves.

          Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the
          specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems
          in awe of the place.

<b>          INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
</b>
          Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is
          tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each
          other with a tiny force.

<b>                          TARS

</b>           One hundred and fifty-seven years.

          Cooper shakes his head in disbelief.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           How are they keeping the lights on
           in this thing?

          Tars, in answer, points to a far door.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           Follow me.

<b>          INT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION
</b>
          A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy
          contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power.

          Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:

          A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.
<b>           131.
</b>
<b>                          TARS
</b>           It's a mini black hole. A remnant
           of the big bang. It will power this
           place forever.

          Tars leads them on.

<b>          EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
</b>
          Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft.
          Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down.

<b>          INT. SIMULATION ROOM
</b>
          In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of
          the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It's a map?

<b>                          TARS
</b>           No. Not a map. This is a simulation
           of the Earth. A perfect simulation.

          Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe.
          Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:

          People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent
          to buy a newspaper.

          Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.

<b>                          TARS (CONT'D)
</b>           They tested each of the technologies
           hundreds of times, trying to find
           the one that would cause the least
           damage and still allow us to leave
           Earth.

          Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
          city. The sequence stops, rewinds.

          This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great
          swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive
          circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth.

<b>                          TARS (CONT'D)
</b>           This was their best solution. A
           massive version of the box we found
           on the ice planet, allowing the entire
           human population to escape.

          At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to
          nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire
<b>           132.
</b>
          population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in
          search of greener pastures.

          Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           So why didn't they return? Why didn't
           they save us?

          Brand is staring at the massive map.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Because they were too late. By the
           time they found this place, the people
           who sent them were dead. They were
           unable to fulfill their mission.

          Tars points to the next room.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           That was the final problem they tried
           to solve.

          Tars moves on.

<b>          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
</b>
          Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with
          hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:

          Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Where do they lead?

          Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping
          some of the wormholes.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           There are millions of them, connecting
           virtually every planetary system in
           the universe. There are thousands
           in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
           stopped mapping them when they found
           what they were looking for.

          Tars walks further. He stops.

          The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic
          version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
          connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the
          dark space above the sphere.
<b>           133.
</b>
<b>                          TARS (CONT'D)
</b>           This was their final creation. They
           had to capture the mini black hole
           just to have enough power to try it.

          Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows
          far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           What does it do?

          Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange
          material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what
          it does.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           They weren't interested in the other
           wormholes because their mission was
           to return home. That one leads back
           to Earth. The Earth they were told
           to return to.

          Tars walks to the controls for the device.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           But that's impossible...

          Tars turns away from the machine.

<b>                          TARS
</b>           It was only used once. The Chinese
           team attempted to travel back in
           time, to Earth just a few years after
           they had left.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Did they make it?

<b>                          TARS
</b>           I don't know.

          Doyle looks back to Cooper.

<b>                          DOYLE
</b>           Do you really think it works?

          Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           We're going to find out.

          Cooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese
           would have suddenly discovered all
           of these incredible technologies.

           slow things down, but you can't ever
           go back. Our home is gone.
           (off his look)
           You listened to all of those messages
           from your family. If you had made
           it back, we would already know.
           There would already be some evidence.

          Cooper looks at the machine.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           If you try to use it, you'll die,

          She puts an arm on his shoulder.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)
</b>           Roth was right, Cooper. We have to

<b>                          COOPER

          Cooper looks up at her.

<b>          INT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION

          Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. The ship is packed
          up and repaired. Brand is looking over their work.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You could have taken one of the other
           ships.

<b>                          BRAND
</b>           This one's done all right by us so
           far.

          Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the
          fractal life-form.

<b>                          BRAND (CONT'D)

          Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside,
          trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back
          to her.

          Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted.
          And he has to turn it down.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I'm sorry. I have to find out what
           happened to my sons. I promised
           them.

          Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to
          change his mind.

<b>                          BRAND

          They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing
          that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back
          to the ship.

          She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside
          and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts
          off and disappears into the darkness.

          Cooper turns away.

          The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the
          space station and closes in on the wormhole.

          Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
<b>           137.
</b>
          The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely
          into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code

          Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He
          unbuckles himself.

          Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
          familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.

          Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It's going to work.

</b>           That's not what I mean. This is the

          Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole
          mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
          well, creating a time machine.

          gun. Points it at Cooper.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           You don't need to do this. We won't
           make it back, but this does. The
           secrets are already right on it.
           Maybe someone found it. There's
           hope.

</b>           You're not stopping me. I'm going
           home.

          Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes
          the airlock.

          Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason
          with him.

          The landing craft detaches from the ship.

<b>          INT. CHINESE LANDING CRAFT
</b>
          Cooper watches, helpless, as Doyle's ship races ahead towards
          the glowing wormhole mouth.

          As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation
          suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it.

          Almost everything.

          Cooper's landing craft spins away from the wormhole mouth.

          A hole opens in the sky with a FIERY EXPLOSION. As the

          probe, which hurtles toward Earth.

          A combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened.
          A MAN is lying under the machine, working.

          The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. Dusts
          himself off.

          It's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for
          the verdict. Murph shakes his head.

<b>                          MURPH

          Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that
          stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able
          to support themselves.

          Murph begins packing up his tools, thinking it over.

          Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp.
          He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going.

          He pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. He
          checks over the engine, lights, prop. Turns the key. Fires
          her up. The diesel wakes with a GRUNT.

          Murph sets the plane down.

          He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down.

          He scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place?

<b>          EXT. FOREST -- DAY

          Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops.

          He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've
          been blown open with dynamite.

<b>          INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY
</b>
          Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.

          The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken
          almost everything.

          Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's
          been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton.
          The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.

          Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to
          salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP.

          In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:
<b>           141.
</b>
          The probe.

          No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it.

<b>          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT
</b>
          Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe
          that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.

          After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice-
          covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive
          is filled with garbage, noise.

          Murph switches off the screen.

          He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns
          back. Picks it up and takes it with him.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

          Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of
          it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient
          laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying
          to decrypt the contents.

          His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from
          the stove.

          Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption
          software. Hits return.

          Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data.

          Murph stares at it, wide eyed.

          Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
          large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
          some of the components and their configuration:

          It's a crude version of the gravitational device.

          Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
          generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.

          The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.
<b>           142.

          Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins
          checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back.
          His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door.

<b>                          EMILY COOPER

</b>           All right. Let me get my jacket.

          Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. Next to it on
          the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC.

          Murph switches off the lights and they walk out.

          After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.

          Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. He
          hears a distant RUMBLE.

          He looks up. His wife is standing by the sink.

<b>                          MURPH
</b>           Where's Emily?

<b>                          WIFE

           with your old projects.
<b>           143.

          Murph stands up. The roof of the barn is visibly shaking.
          He steps outside.

<b>          EXT. YARD, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is
          growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling.

          Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn.

<b>                          EMILY COOPER
</b>           Dad... I'm sorry... I made some

          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.

          Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
          a FIERY display.

          As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:

          The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.

          Murph looks at his daughter.

<b>                          MURPH

          Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.

          This is North America. But it doesn't look much like it.

          Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of
          the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the
          barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as
          if a heavy snow has come and gone.

<b>          SUPER TITLE: "TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER"

          One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick
          clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.

          The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious
          look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small
          container.

          The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough
          right here.

          Cooper starts to walk.

<b>          EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY

          Remarkably, part of Cooper's old house is still standing.

<b>          INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are
          missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can
          still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.

          He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.

          Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
          used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.

          It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has
          had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find.
          But nothing has prepared him for this:

          He is completely alone. Nothing is left.

<b>          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.

          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.

          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.

          As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
          over in seconds.

<b>          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN
</b>
          Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still
          raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move
          now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face
          and stumbles outside.

<b>          EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to
          find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.

          He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the
          fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.

          Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
<b>           145.
</b>
          As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
          of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.

          After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
          ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.

          Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
          what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?

          Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
          driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.

          Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.

          As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
          of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
          forward in the snow.

          He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
          what happens when humans die.

          He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
          eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.

          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.

          As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast
          arctic tundra. He will die alone.

          He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it
          makes its way in through a large open window.

          Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall
          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.

          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the
          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.
          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before
          he can, the door opens behind him.

          A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly.

          Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building
          in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the
          road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the
          landscape curves up, not down.

          The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder-
          shaped space station.

          Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor
          catches him.

<b>                          DOCTOR

           This is the Space Station Joseph A.
           Cooper.

          Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand
          feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of
          green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.

          Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise
          is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.

          Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-

          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
          the old man's desk:

          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:

          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
          family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
          Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.

          Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.

          The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
          leg in the picture.

<b>                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
</b>           That's him.
<b>           148.
</b>
          She points to the old man lying in the bed.

<b>                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
</b>           His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
           Cooper Welling.
<b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           He's your great great grandson.
           He's been waiting a long time for
           you.

          Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.

          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.

          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.

          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
          old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING
</b>
          Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged
          BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
           just start off by saying that. It's
           an incredible and... unexpected honor
           to have you here with us.

          Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
</b>           None of us would be here without the
           efforts of you and the other
           crewmembers of the Endurance.
           (smiles, unconvincingly)
           So I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way. But there are some
           questions I've been told to ask.

          The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill
          George Washington on his expense reports.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Shoot.
<b>           149.
</b>
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           The rangers who found you reported
           that you had released a sample of an
           alien life-form into the wild. Which
           is, unfortunately, against
           regulations.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           It was last of its kind. Their planet
           was destroyed.

          The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           The rangers attempted to isolate the
           life-form, but it had already spread
           out of control. It seems to be
           thriving.

          He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A
          considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.

          Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even
          less comfortable.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Can you tell me why you... elected
           to release the life-form back on
           earth?

          Cooper is still laughing.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Because that was the plan.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           Whose plan?

<b>                          COOPER
</b><b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           I don't know.

          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
          his file. Changes the subject.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           My assistant tells me you've applied
           for a position with the exploration
           fleet.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Feel like I should be pulling my
           weight.
<b>           150.
</b>
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
           truth is, most of the fleet's
           personnel are automated. There are
           a small number of crewed ships. But
           there are great numbers of candidates.
           Very well trained candidates.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I was hoping to enroll in a course.
           Try to get myself up to speed on the
           new systems.

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
           said, you're a hero. But the truth
           is we have somewhat limited resources.

          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           No one's heard anything from Brand?

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
           listed as missing for over 200 years.
           Mind you, I guess you turned up
           eventually, didn't you?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Am I really going to hurt anybody by
           going to look for her? I just need
           a small ship. I made a promise.

          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
          tell this guy the lay of the land?

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
           You're the oldest man in the human
           race. Don't you want to take it
           easy?
           (off his look)
           I hope you understand, we all you
           hold you in the highest possible
           regard.
<b>                          (QUIET)
</b>           Which is why they're never going to
           let you go off by yourself in a
           spaceship. I'm sorry.

          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
          He puts his hands in his pockets.
<b>           151.
</b>
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
</b>           I've got some good news, however.
<b>                          (BIG SMILE)
</b>           We all know about your early life,
           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
           when I was a boy. And I think we
           found something you'll really enjoy.

<b>          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
</b>
          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.

<b>           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
</b>           The machines do most of the work, of
           course, but we were able to get you
           a few acres. You're going to be a
           farmer again.

          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
          and begins working the branch out of the machine.

          He looks miserable.

          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.

<b>          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
</b>
          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.

<b>          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
</b>
          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
          of the bat as an intramural team from the university
          practices.

          Cooper watches. He looks bored.

          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.

          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
          the town center above.

          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
          building high above them.

          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.
<b>           152.
</b>
<b>          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
</b>
          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
          around in the back of his head.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>           Settings: general settings, security

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>           Confirmed. Would you like to make
           any additional changes?

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Sense of humor. New level setting.
           100 percent. Wait.
<b>                          (THINKS)
</b>           80 percent.

          He begins putting the robot back together.

<b>          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
</b>
          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
          cylinder into shade, then darkness.

          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.

<b>          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
</b>
          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.

          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
          floor, sticking to the shadows.

          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.

          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
          a click against the mirror-like floor.

          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.

          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
<b>           153.
</b>
          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.

<b>          INT. SHIP
</b>
          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
          Cooper looks up through the windows.

          The inky black void of space beckons.

          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Where do you want to go first?

          The robot thinks it over.

<b>          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
</b>
          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.

          It's not there.

          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
